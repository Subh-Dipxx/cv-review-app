# Authentication System Updates

## Overview
We've made significant improvements to the authentication system in our CV Review App. These changes ensure a more robust, secure, and user-friendly experience.

## Key Changes

### 1. Cookie-Based Authentication
- Implemented cookie-based authentication to work alongside localStorage
- Added `isLoggedIn` cookie that the middleware checks for protected routes
- Added session expiration tracking

### 2. Enhanced Middleware
- Created a more specific middleware that properly distinguishes between public and protected routes
- Added support for redirecting to the originally requested page after login
- Improved handling of authenticated users trying to access login/register pages

### 3. AuthGuard Component
- Created a reusable AuthGuard component for protecting routes on the client side
- Added loading state handling to improve user experience
- Implemented session expiration warnings

### 4. Session Management
- Added session timeout after 4 hours of inactivity by default
- Added "Remember Me" functionality to extend sessions to 30 days
- Created session refresh on user activity
- Added visual warnings when sessions are about to expire

### 5. User Interface Improvements
- Added a dropdown menu for user account in the navigation
- Improved visual feedback for authentication actions
- Created dedicated settings and profile pages

### 6. Security Enhancements
- Password strength indicator
- Change password functionality
- Clear separation between authentication and application logic

## Protected Routes
The following routes now require authentication:
- `/dashboard`
- `/uploads`
- `/settings`
- `/profile`
- `/change-password`
- All API endpoints that handle user data

## How It Works
1. When a user logs in, both cookies and localStorage are used to store authentication state
2. The middleware checks for the `isLoggedIn` cookie to protect routes
3. Regular activity refreshes the session
4. By default, the session expires after 4 hours of inactivity
5. If "Remember Me" is selected during login, the session will last for 30 days

## Next Steps
- Implement real JWT token validation
- Add two-factor authentication
- Create account recovery options

## Technical Updates and Bug Fixes

### Server/Client Component Separation
- Fixed "Unsupported Server Component" error by properly defining client/server component boundaries
- Created an AppShell component with the "use client" directive to isolate client-side rendering
- Maintained AuthWrapper for backward compatibility, now using AppShell internally
- Moved all client-side logic (authentication, session management, navigation) into client components
- Simplified the root layout.js to be a pure server component

### React Component Optimization
- Resolved "invalid element type" errors by ensuring proper component exports and imports
- Implemented proper React component hierarchy for client-side authentication features
- Added error boundaries around authentication components for graceful error handling
- Improved code organization with clear separation of concerns between UI and auth logic
